Description: Limit of Detection (LOD) reflects an (medical diagnostic)
  instrument's level of sensitivity.  The smaller is the LOD, the
  higher is the sensitivity of the instrument to small quantities of an analyte
  (e.g. copies of DNA per reaction).  Seven binomial regression models
  are fitted to (binary) LOD measurement data and the best model is selected
  from AIC, BIC, or AICc criteria.  Multiple groups of LOD data can be
  incorporated into the model as Random Effect.  The 95% LOD, which is
  the level of analyte concentration that produces 95% positive
  results, and its Confidence Interval, is estimated from the
  selected model via the Delta Method.
