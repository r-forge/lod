Description: Limit of Detection(LOD) is a means of measuring an
  instrument's level of sensitivity. The smaller the LOD, the higher the
  sensitivity of the instrument to small quantities of an analyte (in
  this case copies of bacteria DNA). An accurate estimate of LOD will
  give a level of cut-off that separates positive and negative results
  (in our case the detection or lack of detection for bacteria DNA). Our
  goal is to consolidate various LOD models into a more powerful and
  user-friendly web application featuring easier access, less manual
  intervention, and more information in the form of warnings regarding
  inadequacies of input data.
